Summer UAV Project - Student Aerospace Initiative

I will be creating and leading UGA Student Aerospace Initiative's UAV research team. 
Over summer we will be designing the hardware and software to build our first UAV.
Current ideas for its functions include: agricultural imaging, food delivery with a communications platform.
